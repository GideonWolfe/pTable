# pTable

##  Your chemistry homework just got easier!

pTable is a periodic table reference written in Python, which provides a handy way to quickly access information about various elements from your terminal.


pTable depends on npyscreen, a curses wrapper for Python. Install it for Python 3 with 

`sudo pip3 install npyscreen`

This program is a personal project, and I am only a chemistry student not an expert. Please feel free to suggest corrections and new features!
