# pTable

##  Your chemistry homework just got easier!

pTable is a chemistry reference written in Python, which provides a quick way to perform common chemistry calculations and find useful facts and information.

### Dependencies:

pTable uses a couple dependancies to work correctly. 
`chempy` is a library for analytical chemistry calculations, and `npyscreen` is a library for designing terminal applications.
Install them for Python 3 like so:

`sudo pip3 install chempy`

`sudo pip3 install npyscreen`

This program is a personal project, and I am only a chemistry student not an expert. Please feel free to suggest corrections and new features!
