# pTable

##  Your chemistry homework just got easier!

pTable is a chemistry reference written in Python, which provides a quick way to perform common chemistry calculations and find useful facts and information.

### Dependencies:

pTable uses a couple dependancies to work correctly. 
`chempy` and `mendeleev` are libraries for analytical chemistry calculations and element info, and `npyscreen` is a library for designing terminal applications.
Install them for Python 3 like so:

`sudo pip3 install chempy`

`sudo pip3 install npyscreen`

`sudo pip3 install mendeleev`

### Usage:

to run pTable, simply navigate to the pTable directory and run ptable.py. 

For quick calculations without the GUI, you can use these console commands.

`Usage: ptable [-options]

-help:   Show this message

-compound:  Analyze a compound

-element: Analyze an element

-equation: Balance an equation (in quotes)`

This program is a personal project, and I am only a chemistry student not an expert. Please feel free to suggest corrections and new features!
